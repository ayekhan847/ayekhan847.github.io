    <h1>Final Project: Cluck It!</h1>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>I wanted to build a weight-based feeding system for my chickens. The current problem is that
        their feeder opens for both rats and chickens when stepped on. I would like it to only when a chicken steps on it
        and close when it moves away.To do this, I incorporated a weight requirement activated and measure with a load
        cell and amplifier. The feeder is opened and closed with a servo motor. The microcontroller used is an Arduino Uno.
        The load cell is calibrated to only open the feeder when a weight of at least 900 grams is detected, which is way greater than the
        average weight of a rat but less that that of an average adult hen. Here was the sketch of my intial concept:

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

      <h3>Question 1</h3>
      <p>According to the datasheet, the max current would be 37.2A between pins 2 and 3 of the MOSFET.

      <h3>Question 2</h3>
      <p> 
        This is my schematic showing all the parts needed for this DC motor circuit.
        <img src="a5q2.jpg"/></p>
        The parts include:
        The Arduino Uno Board:
        https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/A000066-datasheet.pdf
        The N-MOSFEt Transistor:

        The Flyback Diode:
        https://components101.com/sites/default/files/component_datasheet/1N4001.pdf
        The Capacitor, since the circuits maximum votage is 12V, I sited a 25V capacitor that gives a safe margin:

      <h3>Question 3</h3>
      <p>Used this website for reference: https://lastminuteengineers.com/l293d-dc-motor-arduino-tutorial/
        <img src="a5q3.jpg"/></p>
        Here is my pseudocode for how I would set this up:
        Set up pins for both motor A and motor B as outputs
        //Start with both motors forward:
        Write Motor A pin 1 HIGH
        Write Motor A pin 2 LOW
        Write Motor B pin 1 HIGH
        Write Motor B pin 2 LOW
        Delay
        //Then both motors backward:
        Write Motor A pin 1 LOW
        Write Motor A pin 2 HIGH
        Write Motor B pin 1 LOW
        Write Motor B pin 2 HIGH
        Delay
        //Then Motor A forward, Motor B backward to turn right
        Write Motor A pin 1 HIGH
        Write Motor A pin 2 LOW
        Write Motor B pin 1 LOW
        Write Motor B pin 2 HIGH
        Delay
        //Then Motor A backward, Motor B forward to turn left
        Write Motor A pin 1 LOW
        Write Motor A pin 2 HIGH
        Write Motor B pin 1 HIGH
        Write Motor B pin 2 LOW
        Delay
      </p>
