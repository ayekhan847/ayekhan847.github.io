        <p>I calculated that each resistor for the red LED has to have at least 160 Ohms. I rounded up 
        when choosing which resistor to use from the ones I had, and used 220 Ohm resistors for each LED.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

      <h3>Question 1</h3>
      <p>Here is a graph with X axis is time and Y axis is voltage for each of the 3 LEDs:  
         <img src="graph.jpg"/></p>

      <h3>Question 2</h3>
      <p>Reading the Arduino Uno Rev3 tech specs, I see that the current per I/O is a recommended 20mA. 
        However, going into the microcontroller (ATmega328P) specs, I see that the chip wide limit is 200mA. 
        Assuming that I am using pins 2-13 (as 0,1 are only for RX and TX), and 12 pins at 20mA, 
        that makes the total current to be 240mA, this is way higher than the current limit and would be too high. 
        If I want to stay at 200mA for the entire chip, then the max I could go is 10 pins at each 20mA. 
        To be safe, I would probably do 9 pins to make sure I don’t go over the 200mA maximum.  
        This would result in a 180mA current draw. </p>

      <h3>Question 4</h3>
      <p>Instead of 1000 ms in between, I would bring it all the way down to 1ms. 
        I tried it with 15ms and I couldn’t see the blink in between.  </p>

      <h3>Question 5</h3>
      <p>I searched Google for the specs sheet for the Arduino Uno Rev3 and it gave me the chip-wide limit. 
        I still went through the MegaAVR Data Sheet which had many pages and it took me a while to find the 
        Electrical Characteristics (on page 308). I found that the AI summary on the top of Google gave me the 200 Current Vcc 
        and GND Pins limit way faster than searching for it through the pages. At one point I thought I was overthinking question 2,
         and it was just asking for the maximum current that could flow, excluding the point that the circuit board might break, 
         but I still took the practical route and realistic answer. </p>
